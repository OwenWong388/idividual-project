# API

I have been using Twitter API and Facebook Grpah API for this project.<br />
In the GUI there have been data stored which capture by the Twitter API and Facebook Graph API<br />
first to use this app enter hello<br />
Then enter:<br />
1 to access data capture by Twitter API<br />
2 to access data capture by Facebook Graph API<br />
If chose 1, the app will ask to access either tweet data or user data<br />
Enter 1 for tweet and 2 for user<br />
Facebook data will show all the data at once<br />
After finish reading data or search new data<br />
hit ok and will bring you back to the page which you need to enter hello<br />
